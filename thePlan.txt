        - Need: Frequency display (both count and percentage)
    
    (c) ❌ Character replacement functionality
        - Need: Input field for replacement character C
        - Need: Replace all instances of S characters in T with C
        - Need: Show before/after text comparison

11. WORD ANALYSIS FUNCTIONALITY 🚧
    NEEDED: Word-based text analysis with character filtering

        - Need: Word counting algorithm
        - Need: Proper punctuation handling
        - Need: Display total word count
    
    (b) ❌ List words beginning with characters from string S
        - Need: Word filtering by starting character
        - Need: Group words by starting character
        - Need: Display format: "Character: word1, word2, word3..."

12. STOP WORDS PROCESSING 🚧
    NEEDED: Advanced text filtering with stop words
    
    (a) ❌ Remove stop words P from text T
        - Need: Input for up to 10 stop words
